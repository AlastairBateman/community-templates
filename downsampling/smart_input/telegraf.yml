        # Telegraf Configuration
        #
        # Telegraf is entirely plugin driven. All metrics are gathered from the
        # declared inputs, and sent to the declared outputs.
        #
        # Plugins must be declared in here to be active.
        # To deactivate a plugin, comment out the name and any variables.
        #
        # Use 'telegraf -config telegraf.conf -test' to see what metrics a config
        # file would generate.
        #
        # Environment variables can be used anywhere in this config file, simply surround
        # them with ${}. For strings the variable must be within quotes (ie, "${STR_VAR}"),
        # for numbers and booleans they should be plain (ie, ${INT_VAR}, ${BOOL_VAR})
        
        
        # Global tags can be specified here in key="value" format.
        [global_tags]
        # dc = "us-east-1" # will tag all metrics with dc=us-east-1
        # rack = "1a"
        ## Environment variables can be used as tags, and throughout the config file
        # user = "$USER"
        
        
        # Configuration for telegraf agent

        ## Default data collection interval for all inputs

        ## Rounds collection interval to 'interval'
        ## ie, if interval="10s" then always collect on :00, :10, :20, etc.
        round_interval = true
        
        ## Telegraf will send metrics to outputs in batches of at most
        ## metric_batch_size metrics.
        ## This controls the size of writes that Telegraf sends to output plugins.
        metric_batch_size = 1000
        
        ## Maximum number of unwritten metrics per output.  Increasing this value
        ## allows for longer periods of output downtime without dropping metrics at the
        ## cost of higher maximum memory usage.
        metric_buffer_limit = 10000
        
        ## Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount.
        ## Each plugin will sleep for a random time within jitter before collecting.
        ## This can be used to avoid many plugins querying things like sysfs at the
        ## same time, which can have a measurable effect on the system.
        collection_jitter = "0s"
        
        ## Default flushing interval for all outputs. Maximum flush_interval will be
        ## flush_interval + flush_jitter
        flush_interval = "10s"
        ## Jitter the flush interval by a random amount. This is primarily to avoid
        ## large write spikes for users running a large number of telegraf instances.
        ## ie, a jitter of 5s and interval 10s means flushes will happen every 10-15s
        flush_jitter = "0s"
        
        ## By default or when set to "0s", precision will be set to the same
        ## timestamp order as the collection interval, with the maximum being 1s.
        ##   ie, when interval = "10s", precision will be "1s"
        ##       when interval = "250ms", precision will be "1ms"
        ## Precision will NOT be used for service inputs. It is up to each individual
        ## service input to set the timestamp at the appropriate precision.
        ## Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s".

        ## The logfile will be rotated after the time interval specified.  When set
        ## to 0 no time based rotation is performed.  Logs are rotated only when
        ## written to, if there is no log activity rotation may be delayed.

        ## The logfile will be rotated when it becomes larger than the specified
