  ## The URLs of the InfluxDB cluster nodes.

  ## Multiple URLs can be specified for a single cluster, only ONE of the
  ## urls will be written to each interval.
  ## urls exp: http://127.0.0.1:9999
  urls = ["http://192.168.1.47:9999"]

  ## Token for authentication.

  ## Organization is the name of the organization you wish to write to; must exist.

  ## Destination bucket to write into.

  ## Default data collection interval for all inputs, can be changed as per collection interval needs

# Read metrics from Microsoft SQL Server
[[inputs.sqlserver]]
  ## Specify instances to monitor with a list of connection strings.
  ## All connection parameters are optional.
  ## By default, the host is localhost, listening on default port, TCP 1433.
  ##   for Windows, the user is the currently running AD user (SSO).
  ##   See https://github.com/denisenkom/go-mssqldb for detailed connection
  ##   parameters, in particular, tls connections can be created like so:
  ##   "encrypt=true;certificate=<cert>;hostNameInCertificate=<SqlServer host fqdn>"
  # servers = [
  #  "Server=192.168.1.10;Port=1433;User Id=<user>;Password=<pw>;app name=telegraf;log=1;",
  # ]

  ## Optional parameter, setting this to 2 will use a new version
  ## of the collection queries that break compatibility with the original
  ## dashboards.
  ## Version 2 - is compatible from SQL Server 2012 and later versions and also for SQL Azure DB
  query_version = 2

  ## If you are using AzureDB, setting this to true will gather resource utilization metrics
  # azuredb = false

  ## Possible queries
  ## Version 2:
  ## - PerformanceCounters
  ## - WaitStatsCategorized
  ## - DatabaseIO
  ## - ServerProperties
  ## - MemoryClerk
  ## - Schedulers
  ## - SqlRequests
  ## - VolumeSpace
  ## - Cpu
  ## Version 1:
  ## - PerformanceCounters
  ## - WaitStatsCategorized
  ## - CPUHistory
  ## - DatabaseIO
  ## - DatabaseSize
  ## - DatabaseStats
  ## - DatabaseProperties
  ## - MemoryClerk
  ## - VolumeSpace
  ## - PerformanceMetrics
